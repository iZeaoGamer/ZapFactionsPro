The .phar plugin works! How-To Install:

1. Download most recent .phar build from https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci/ZPlayzMCPE/ZapFactionsPro/ZapFactionsPro

2. Upload .phar plugin into the Plugins folder in your server files.

3. Restart your server.

4. If it says anywhere in the console "Loading plugin FactionsPro v1.9.0" then it worked! Enjoy :)

(5. **If** it didn't show up in console during server loading, check for errors at the top of console history. If there is an error, please report to me here. If there is **no** error, you likely did not fully install the plugin or did not put it in the correct folder.)
**Hint: Your plugins folder will be here 95% of the time: PocketMine\Server\Plugins**
